<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Qualifications, Experience and Training</h3>
<p>
I qualified in 1997 and am an Accredited member of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).<br>
<br>
You can find me on the BACP register <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/profile/84dd4be6-5190-e711-80e8-3863bb349ac0/Therapist">here</a> and am insured.<br>
<br>I also qualified as a Yoga teacher (200 hours) in 2023.<br><br>
	
I have worked within various roles within Special Education Needs and 
Disabilities (SEND), in Education (Further Education College and 
Schools, both Primary and Secondary), with the National Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), Place2Be (Improving 
Children's Mental Health in Schools), Your Healthcare (working with 
children with Autism) within Domestic Violence projects (Women's Aid) 
and Cruse Bereavement Care.<br>
<br>
I have been counselling both adults and children for over 10 years and 
have gained specialist experience and expertise in Neurodivergence such as Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) particularly Asperger's and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
</p>
<h3>Specialisms</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ADHD Or VAST (Variable Attention Stimulus Trait)*</li>
	<li>Autism Spectrum Condition (Aspergers)</li>
	<li>Anxiety</li>
	<li>Identity</li>
</ul>
<sub>*Particularly with women and adolescent girls who may have spent the majority of their lives "masking", sometimes without realising.</sub><br>
<p>Having worked with people of all ages in different settings as a counsellor my work with professionals and young adults took
a positive turn towards somatic embodiment practice of connecting the mind with the body and slowing down 
the pace within oneself to reduce stress and anxiety and raise self-esteem and confidence.
</p>

<p>My personal yoga practice has been consistent for over 10 years, my initiation being over 20 years ago. I enjoy Hot Yoga, Vinyasa, Hatha, Yin and Nidra.</p>
<p>My one to one yoga teaching has included adults and teenagers whereby the sessions are all about you and we use the present moment to work through 
past patterns leading towards creating new neural pathways 
in the brain positively triggered by embodied practices. Healthy habits can become second nature in times of stress.</p>
<p>You can listen to my guest appearances on these Spotify ADHD podcasts here and here.</p>
<p>Read my contributions to articles related to ADHD 1 here and article 2 here (click here to access archive of web article 2).</p>

<h2>What to Expect:Online Counselling</h2>
<p>1. Online One to One therapeutic sessions on Zoom</p>
<p>We'd start with an initial assessment for me to be aware of the 
reason(s) for you (or your child) to want counselling and the nature of 
difficulties, as well as for you to ask questions.<br>
<br>
I'll also talk through the process of counselling.<br>
<br>
Namely:
</p><ul>
	<li>I will not pressure you into talking</li>
	<li>You can bring issues within your own pace</li>
	<li>The process will be centred around your needs (hence the assessment process to identify your needs)</li>
	<li>The counselling is confidential.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only exemption being that if you are a danger to yourself or others 
in which case I would follow the BACP Therapeutic Guidelines and Ethical Framework. This is standard practice 
and is part of my responsibility to you and can be explained further prior to commencement of therapy. I work within BACP's Ethical 
Framework found <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/events-and-resources/ethics-and-standards/ethical-framework-for-the-counselling-professions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I hold an enhanced DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificate.</p>
