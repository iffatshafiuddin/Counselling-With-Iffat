<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Qualifications, Experience and Training</h3>
<p>
I qualified in 1997 and am an Accredited member of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).<br>
<br>
You can find me on the BACP register <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/profile/84dd4be6-5190-e711-80e8-3863bb349ac0/Therapist">here</a> and am insured.<br>
<br>I also qualified as a Yoga teacher (200 hours) in 2023.<br><br>
	
I have worked within various roles within Special Education Needs and 
Disabilities (SEND), in Education (Further Education College and 
Schools, both Primary and Secondary), with the National Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), Place2Be (Improving 
Children's Mental Health in Schools), Your Healthcare (working with 
children with Autism) within Domestic Violence projects (Women's Aid) 
and Cruse Bereavement Care.<br>
<br>
I have been counselling both adults and children for over 10 years and 
have gained specialist experience and expertise in Neurodivergence such as Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) particularly Asperger's and Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
</p>
<h3>Specialisms</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ADHD Or VAST (Variable Attention Stimulus Trait)*</li>
	<li>Autism Spectrum Condition (Aspergers)</li>
	<li>Anxiety</li>
	<li>Identity</li>
</ul>
<sub>*Particularly with women and adolescent girls who may have spent the majority of their lives "masking", sometimes without realising.</sub><br>
<p>Having worked with people of all ages in different settings as a counsellor my work with professionals and young adults took
a positive turn towards somatic embodiment practice of connecting the mind with the body and slowing down 
the pace within oneself to reduce stress and anxiety and raise self-esteem and confidence.
</p>

<p>My personal yoga practice has been consistent for over 10 years, my initiation being over 20 years ago. I enjoy Hot Yoga, Vinyasa, Hatha, Yin and Nidra.</p>
<p>My one to one yoga teaching has included adults and teenagers whereby the sessions are all about you and we use the present moment to work through 
past patterns leading towards creating new neural pathways 
in the brain positively triggered by embodied practices. Healthy habits can become second nature in times of stress.</p>

<h2>What to Expect: Online Counselling</h2>
<p>1. Online One to One therapeutic sessions on Zoom</p>
<p>We'd start with an initial assessment for me to be aware of the 
reason(s) for you (or your child) to want counselling and the nature of 
difficulties, as well as for you to ask questions.<br>
<br>
I'll also talk through the process of counselling.<br>
<br>
Namely:
</p><ul>
	<li>I will not pressure you into talking</li>
	<li>You can bring issues within your own pace</li>
	<li>The process will be centred around your needs (hence the assessment process to identify your needs)</li>
	<li>The counselling is confidential.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only exemption being that if you are a danger to yourself or others 
in which case I would follow the BACP Therapeutic Guidelines and Ethical Framework. This is standard practice 
and is part of my responsibility to you and can be explained further prior to commencement of therapy. I work within BACP's Ethical 
Framework found <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/events-and-resources/ethics-and-standards/ethical-framework-for-the-counselling-professions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I hold an enhanced DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificate.</p>
<h2>What to Expect: Yoga</h2>
<p>2. Yoga One to One in-person incorporating The Polyvagal Theory </p>
<p>Being a Counsellor and Yoga teacher I intertwine both elements in my one-to-one sessions. The Polyvagal Theory – The Vagus Nerve - 
	(Stephen Porges:2011*), interestingly enough, is mirrored in ancient yogic philosophy which I combine.<br>
	The Polyvagal Theory explains how to understand and befriend our internal surveillance system. This system via the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
	nervous system, searches for cues of social engagement, connection and safety and cues of threat, danger and disconnection which 
	can lead to appreciating and managing our emotions.<br>
	This prevents our brains from becoming hijacked and consumed by intense 
	overwhelming feelings aiming to self-regulate via co-regulation for example in one-to-one specific-to-you yoga. </p>
<p>A key factor for success comes from attuning to the needs of my clients by building a solid foundation based on social reciprocity 
	and rapport, and organically adapting the sessions to your needs in any given moment. Expect playfulness, challenge and specific 
	education relating to YOUR mind and body. Having a counselling and yoga background provides a perfect balance.</p>
Firstly we’ll have an initial one to one assessment to:
	<ul>
		<li>delve into your best hopes</li>
		<li>explore your experience of moving your body dynamically</li>
		<li>talk through your mental and physical health history</li>
		<li>create a yoga therapeutic plan (with direction and built-in flexibility required to adapt to your moment-to-moment needs)</li>
		
	</ul>…finishing off with yoga. A review will follow at session 6.
	<p>I offer flexible times and can travel to your home or work-place within/near the following areas:
		<br> Kingston, Richmond, West London and parts of Central London.</p>
One-to-one yoga sessions include: 
	<ul>
		<li>The Polyvagal Theory and how this influences your life, leading to greater self-awareness 
		and an increased understanding of ways to lower stress and anxiety specific to you</li>
		<li>somatic practices and asanas (poses) in Vinyasa (flowing) or Hatha (slower) yoga focusing on recognising and understanding 
			your body under stress or in a state of anxiety including Neuroception (perceived threat/safety using Polyvagal Theory)</li>
		<li>building strength, focus, endurance and concentration in both mind and body leading to greater emotional resilience</li>
		<li>pranayama: different types of deep breathing to help initiate the parasympathetic nervous system whilst understanding 
			the role of Polyvagal Theory in stimulating the vagus nerve within subdiaphragmatic and supradiaphragmatic locations in the body</li>
		<li>relaxing Yoga Nidra (yogic sleep) helping to sustain rest and restoration so your body becomes 
			familiar with being in an extended relaxed state by ‘befriending’ the parasympathetic nervous system (time permitting)</li>
		
	</ul>The sessions focus on self-regulation from co-regulation with a view of extending the duration and experience of calm.<br>
	
<br>You don’t have to relive trauma to heal because “The Body Keeps the Score”.**</br>
	
<br>Healing can come from the release experienced in yoga.<br>
	
<br>I abide by the Yoga Alliance Professionals Code of Practice.<br>
