<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Qualifications, Experience and Training</h3>
<p>
I qualified in 1997 and am a member of the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).<br>
<br>
You can find me on the BACP register <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/profile/84dd4be6-5190-e711-80e8-3863bb349ac0/Therapist">here</a>.<br>
<br>
I have worked within various roles within Special Education Needs and 
Disabilities (SEND), in Education (Further Education College and 
Schools, both Primary and Secondary), with the National Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), Place2Be (Improving 
Children's Mental Health in Schools), Your Healthcare (working with 
children with Autism) within Domestic Violence projects (Women's Aid) 
and Cruse Bereavement Care.<br>
<br>
I have been counselling both adults and children for over 10 years and 
have gained specialist experience and expertise within Special 
Educational Needs (Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) such as Asperger's, 
Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Social 
Communication Difficulties).
</p>

</ul>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>We'd start with an initial assessment for me to be aware of the 
reason(s) for you (or your child) to want counselling and the nature of 
difficulties, as well as for you to ask questions.<br>
<br>
Sessions take place in North Kingston (please see Covid-19 restrictions below)<br>
<br>
I'll also talk through the process of counselling.<br>
<br>
Namely:
</p><ul>
	<li>I will not pressure you into talking</li>
	<li>You can bring issues within your own pace</li>
	<li>The process will be centred around your needs (hence the assessment process to identify your needs)</li>
	<li>The counselling is confidential.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>The only exemption being that if you are a danger to yourself or others 
in which case I would have to break confidentiality as per BACP 
therapeutic guidelines and Ethical Framework. This is standard practice 
and is part of my responsibility to you. I work within BACP's Ethical 
Framework found <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/events-and-resources/ethics-and-standards/ethical-framework-for-the-counselling-professions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I hold an enhanced DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificate.</p>
